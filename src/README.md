## Path to HSP

### Results we must prove

+ **Obs 2.0**. Composing homs gives a hom.

+ **Obs 2.1**. Equalizer of homs is a subuniverse.

+ **Obs 2.2**. Homs are determined on generating sets

  (See UAFST Ex 1.4.6.b)

+ **Obs 2.3**. If A, B are fin, X generates 𝑨, then |Hom(𝑨, 𝑩)| ≤ |B|^|X|.

+ **Obs 2.4**. Factorization of homs.  

  If g ∈ Epi(𝑨, 𝑩), h ∈ Hom(𝑨, 𝑪), ker g ⊆ ker h, then ∃ k ∈ Hom(𝑩, 𝑪), h = k ∘ g.

+ **Obs 2.5**. If Aᵢ ≤ 𝑨 for all i in some set I, then ⋂ᵢ Aᵢ is a subuniverse of 𝑨.

+ **Obs 2.6**. (Inductive version of Sg^𝑨)      
  𝑨 an algebra in S and A₀ a subset of A. Define, by recursion on n, Aₙ as follows:

    If A₀ = ∅, then Aₙ = ∅ for all n<ω.

    If A₀ ≠ ∅, then A_{n+1} = Aₙ ∪ { f a ∣ f ∈ F, a ∈ Fin(ρ f) -> Aₙ}.

  Then the subuniverse of 𝑨 generated by A₀ is Sg^𝑨(A₀) = ⋃ₙ Aₙ.


+ **Obs 2.7** (Inductive version of Clo F)  
  Let A be a set, F ⊆ Op(A):= ⋃ₙ A^Aⁿ a collection of ops on A.
  Define F₀ := Proj(A) (the projections on A), and ∀ 0 ≤ n < ω, let

    F_{n+1} := Fₙ ∪ { f g | f ∈ F, g : Fin(ρ f) -> Fₙ ∩ (Fin(ρg) -> A) }.

  Then Clo(F) = ⋃ₙ Fₙ.

+ **Obs 2.8**. Lift of map h : X -> A extends uniquly to a hom 𝑻(X) -> 𝑨.     

  1. 𝑻 := 𝑻_σ(X) is generated by X.

  2. ∀ 𝑨 = ⟨A, F^𝑨⟩, ∀ g: X → A, ∃! hom h: 𝑻 → 𝑨,  h|_X = g.

+ **Obs 2.9**. Homs commute with terms.  
  Let t ∈ T_σ (X) be an n-ary term, t^𝑨 its interpretation in 𝑨, so

    t^𝑨 a = t^𝑨 (a 0, a 1, ..., a (n-1)), for each a : Fin(n) -> A.

  Similarly for 𝑩, have t^𝑩: (Fin(n) -> B) -> B. If g: 𝑨 → 𝑩 is a hom, then g ∘ a: Fin(n) → B is the n-tuple whose i-th component is (g ∘ a) i = g(a i), and g(t^𝑨 a) = t^𝑩(g ∘ a) holds.

+ **Obs 2.10**. Terms respect congruences.   
  If θ ∈ Con 𝑨 and a, a': Fin(n) -> A are n-tuples over A, then

    (a, a') ∈ θ  ⟹  (t^𝑨 a, t^𝑨 a') ∈ θ.

+ **Obs 2.11** (subuniverse generation as image of terms)  
  If Y is a subset of A, then

    Sg^{𝑨}(Y) = { t^𝑨 a : t ∈ T_σ(X_n), n ∈ ℕ, a: Fin(ρ t) -> Y }.

+ **Obs 2.12**. ∀ 𝒦 (class of structures) each of 𝖲(𝒦), 𝖧(𝒦), 𝖯(𝒦), 𝕍(𝒦) satisfies exaxtly the same set of identities as does 𝒦.

+ **Obs 2.13**. 𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q iff ∀ 𝑨 ∈ 𝒦, ∀ h ∈ Hom(𝑻(X_ω), 𝑨), h p^𝑨 = h q^𝑨`.

+ **Obs 2.14** Let 𝒦 be a class of algebras, p ≈ q an equation. TFAE.
  1. 𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q.
  2. (p, q) belongs to the congruence λ_𝒦 on 𝑻(X_ω).
  3. 𝑭_𝒦(X_ω) ⊧ p ≈ q.

+ **Obs 2.15**. Let 𝒦 be a class of algebras, p and q terms (say, n-ary), Y a set, and y₁,..., yₙ distinct elements of Y. Then 𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q iff
  p^{𝑭_𝒦(Y)}(y₁,..., yₙ) =  q^{𝑭_𝒦}(Y)(y₁, ..., yₙ). In particular, 𝒦 ⊧ p ≈ q iff 𝑭_𝒦(Xₙ) ⊧ p ≈ q.

  (The converse of Obs 2.15 is **Birkhoff's HSP Theorem**.)

  The next result is not needed for HSP, but we should probably try to prove it.

+ **Obs 2.16**.  Every  finitely  generated  variety  is  locally finite.

  The converse of the last theorem is false.  That is, ∃ loc fin varieties that are not finitely generated
  (e.g., the variety of p-algebras; see UAFSt Cor. 4.55).

### Varieties

(cf Def 1.10 of Bergman)

Let 𝓚 be a class of similar algebras. We write

  + H(𝓚) for the class of all homomorphic images of members of 𝓚;
  + S(𝓚) for the class of all algebras isomorphic to a subalgebra of a member of 𝓚;
  + P(𝓚) for the class of all algebras isomorphic to a direct product of members of 𝓚;

We say that 𝓚 is closed under the formation of homomorphic images if H(𝓚) ⊆ 𝓚, and similarly for subalgebras and products.

Notice that all three of these "class operators" are designed so that for every class 𝓚, H(𝓚), S(𝓚), P(𝓚) are closed under isomorphic images.

On those rare occasions that we need it, we can write I(𝓚) for the class of algebras isomorphic to a member of 𝓚.

Finally, we call 𝓚 a VARIETY if it is closed under each of H, S and P.
