**Author**. [William DeMeo](https://williamdemeo.gitlab.io)

**Affiliation**. [Department of Algebra](https://www.mff.cuni.cz/en/ka), [Charles University in Prague](https://cuni.cz/UKEN-1.html)

**PDF documentation**. [ualib-24Jan2021.pdf](ualib-24Jan2021.pdf)

**Abstract**. The [Agda Universal Algebra Library](https://ualib.gitlab.io/) ([UALib](https://ualib.gitlab.io/)) is a library of types and programs (theorems and proofs) that formalizes the foundations of universal algebra in Martin-Löf type theory using the [Agda](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) proof assistant language.

This is the main repository for the Agda UALib. Below are instructions for getting the UALib installed on your machine.  I hope that these steps work for you; they work on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine, but I haven't tested them on a fresh distro, or any other OS, so... 

...in any case, please [email me](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com) if you have trouble.

---------------------------

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code, as well as files that generate [documentation](https://ualib.gitlab.io/), for the [Agda Universal Algebra Library](https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io), aka [Agda UALib](https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io).

The docs are served at [ualib.org](https://ualib.gitlab.io/), and are automatically generated from the .lagda files using the script [generate-md](https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/generate-md). See the section on [Generating the documentation](#generating-the-documentation) below.

-----------------------------

## Install Agda

Agda [2.6.1](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1/getting-started/installation.html) is required. 

If you don't have Agda and agda2-mode installed, follow the [official installation instructions](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0/getting-started/installation.html) or [Martin Escardo's installation instructions](INSTALL_AGDA.md) to help you set up Agda and Emacs.

-----------------------------

## Download the UALib

[Clone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/command-line-commands.html) the repository to your local machine using **ONE** of the following alternative commands:

``` sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io.git
```

**OR**, if you have a gitlab account and have configured [ssh keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/),


``` sh
git clone git@gitlab.com:ualib/ualib.gitlab.io.git
```

This creates a directory on your local machine called `ualib.gitlab.io`. The UALib source code files reside in subdirectories of `ualib.gitlab.io/UALib` and have the `.lagda` extension.

Having installed Agda and cloned the `ualib.gitlab.io` repository, you should now be able to work with the source code contained in the .lagda files, such as UALib.lagda or any of it submodules. For example, you might start by loading the file [UALib/Prelude/Preliminaries.lagda](https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io/-/blob/master/UALib/Prelude/Preliminaries.lagda) into Emacs and check that Agda can type-check that file using the command `C-c C-l`.

Other Emacs keybindings are described in the [emacs-mode.html#keybindings](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.1.1/tools/emacs-mode.html#keybindings) section of the [Agda docs](https://agda.readthedocs.io).

--------------------------------------------

## Generating the documentation

The html pages at [ualib.org](https://ualib.gitlab.io) were generated from the [literate](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/literate-programming.html) Agda (.lagda) files in this repository.  These files contain formal, verified, mathematical theorems and proof appearing within `\begin{code}...\end{code}` blocks, as well as some mathematical discussions outside those blocks written in markdown.

The html documentation is available at [ualib.org](https://ualib.gitlab.io), so there is usually no need for end-users to generate the documentation pages locally. However, if you want to fix something or help develop improved versions of the docs or code, you may want to update and render the documentation html pages on your local machine. In that case, the instructions in this section may be helpful.

To generate the html documentation pages and serve them locally you will need bundler and jekyll.  If you're using Ubuntu 18.04 or something similar, the [INSTALL_JEKYLL.md]() file gives intructions for installing these two programs.

The html pages are generated by Agda with the following command:

```
agda --html --html-highlight=code UALib.lagda
```

This generates a set of markdown files that are then converted to html by jekyll with the command

```shell
bundle exec jekyll build
```

In practice, we use the script `generate-md`, to process the lagda files and put the resulting markdown output in the right place, and then using the script `jekyll-serve` to invoke the following commands

```
cp html/UALib.md index.md
cp html/*.html html/*.md .
bundle install --path vendor
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --incremental
```

This causes jekyll to serve the web pages locally so we can inspect them by pointing a browser to [127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000).

#### <a id="attributions-and-citations">Attributions and citations</a>

Most of the mathematical results that formalized in the [UAlib](https://ualib.gitlab.io) are already well known.

Regarding the Agda source code in the [Agda UALib](https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io/), this is mainly due to the author with one major caveat: we benefited greatly from, and the library depends upon, the lecture notes on [Univalent Foundations and Homotopy Type Theory](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/index.html) and the [Type Topology](https://github.com/martinescardo/TypeTopology) Agda Library by [Martin Hötzel Escardo](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe).  The author is indebted to Martin for making his library and notes available and for teaching a course on type theory in Agda at the [Midlands Graduate School in the Foundations of Computing Science](http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/mgs2019/) in Birmingham in 2019.
