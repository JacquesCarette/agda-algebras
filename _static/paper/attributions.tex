The mathematical results described in this paper have well known \emph{informal} proofs. Our main contribution is the formalization, mechanization, and verification of the statements and proofs of these results in dependent type theory using Agda.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Agda source code described in this paper is due to the author, with the following caveat: the \ualib depends on the \typetopology library of \MartinEscardo~\cite{MHE}.  Each dependency is carefully accounted for and mentioned in this paper. For the sake of completeness and clarity, and to keep the paper mostly self-contained, we repeat some definitions from the \typetopology library, but in each instance we cite the original source.\footnote{In the \ualib, such instances occur only inside hidden modules that are never actually used, followed immediately by a statement that imports the code in question from its original source.}
