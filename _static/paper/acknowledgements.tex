The author thanks Cliff Bergman, Hyeyoung Shin, and Siva Somayyajula for supporting and contributing to this project, Adreas Abel for helpful corrections (via gitlab merge request), and \MartinEscardo for creating the \TypeTopology library and teaching us about it at the \href{http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/mgs2019/}{2019 Midlands Graduate School in Computing Science}~\cite{MHE}. Of course, this work would not exist in its current form without the Agda 2 language by Ulf Norell.\footnote{Agda 2 is partially based on code from Agda 1 by Catarina Coquand and Makoto Takeyama, and from Agdalight by Ulf Norell and Andreas Abel.}
