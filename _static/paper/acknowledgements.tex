The mathematical results described in this paper have well known \emph{informal} proofs. Our main contribution is the \emph{formalization} (and machine-implementation and verification) of the statements and proofs of these results in dependent type theory using Agda.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Agda source code described in this paper is due to the author, with the following caveat: \ualib depends on the \typetopology library of \MartinEscardo~\cite{MHE}.  Each dependency is carefully accounted for and mentioned in this paper.

For the sake of completeness and clarity, and to keep the paper relatively self-contained, we sometimes repeat definitions from the \typetopology library, but in each instance we include a citation to the original source.\footnote{In the \ualib, such instances occur only inside hidden modules that are never actually used, followed immediately by an statement that imports the code in question from its original source.}

The author thanks Cliff Bergman, Hyeyoung Shin, and Siva Somayyajula for supporting and contributing to this project, Adreas Abel for helpful corrections (via gitlab merge request), and \MartinEscardo for creating the \TypeTopology library and teaching us about it at the \href{http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/mgs2019/}{2019 Midlands Graduate School in Computing Science}~\cite{MHE}. Of course, this work would not exist in its current form without the Agda 2 language by Ulf Norell.\footnote{Agda 2 is partially based on code from Agda 1 by Catarina Coquand and Makoto Takeyama, and from Agdalight by Ulf Norell and Andreas Abel.}
