The Agda Universal Algebra Library (UALib) is a library of types and programs
(theorems and proofs) we developed to formalize the foundations of universal
algebra in dependent type theory using the Agda programming language and proof
assistant.
The UALib includes a substantial collection of definitions, theorems, and proofs
from general algebra and equational logic, including many examples that exhibit
the power of inductive and dependent types for representing and reasoning about
relations, algebraic structures, and equational theories.
In this paper we discuss the logical foundations on which the library is built,
and describe the types defined in the first 13 modules of the library. Special
attention is given to aspects of the library that seem most interesting or
challenging from a type theory or mathematical foundations perspective.
