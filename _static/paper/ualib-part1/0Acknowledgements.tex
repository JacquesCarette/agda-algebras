The author thanks Cliff Bergman, Hyeyoung Shin, and Siva Somayyajula for supporting and contributing to this project, Adreas Abel for helpful corrections, and three anonymous referees for invaluable feedback on an early draft of this work.  Thanks are also owed to \MartinEscardo for creating the \typetopology library and teaching us about it at the \href{http://events.cs.bham.ac.uk/mgs2019/}{2019 Midlands Graduate School in Computing Science}~\cite{MHE}. Finally, the \agdaualib would not exist in its current form without the \agda language, for which we thank the Agda Team (Andreas Abel, Guillaume Allais, Liang-Ting Chen, Jesper Cockx, Nils Anders Danielsson, Víctor López Juan, Ulf Norell, Andrés Sicard-Ramírez, Andrea Vezzosi, and Tesla Ice Zhang).
% Agda 2 is partially based on code from Agda 1 by Catarina Coquand and Makoto Takeyama, and from Agdalight by Ulf Norell and Andreas Abel.}
