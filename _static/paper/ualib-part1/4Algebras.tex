\section{Algebra Types}\label{sec:algebra-types}
Finally we are ready to present the \ualibhtml{Algebras} module of the \agdaualib. Here we use type theory and Agda to codify the most basic objects of universal algebra, such as \emph{operations} and \emph{signatures} (\S\ref{sec:oper-sign}), \emph{algebras} (\S\ref{sec:algebras}), \emph{product algebras} (\S\ref{sec:product-algebras}), \emph{congruence relations} and \emph{quotient algebras}~(\S\ref{congruences}).

A popular way to represent algebraic structures in type theory is with record types. The Sigma type provides an equivalent alternative that we happen to prefer and we use it throughout the library, both for consistency and because of its direct connection to the existential quantifier of logic. Recall that inhabitants of the type \ad Σ~\ab x~\af ꞉~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P are pairs (\ab x,~\ab p) such that \abt{x}{X} and \ab p~\as : \ab P~\ab x. In this sense, when such a Sigma type is inhabited we conclude, ``there exists \ab x in \ab X such that \ab P~\ab x holds;'' in symbols, \as ∃~\ab x~\af ∈~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x.  % Indeed, an inhabitant of  \ad Σ~\ab x~\af ꞉~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x is a pair (\ab x , \ab p) such that \ab x inhabits \ab X and \ab p is a proof of \ab P \ab x.
Moreover, the pair (\ab x,~\ab p) is not merely a proof of the logical sentence \as ∃~\ab x~\af ∈~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x; it is also a \emph{witness} of the truth of this sentence. We sometimes say that a proof of an existentially quantified sentence has ``computational content'' if it provides such a witness, or a function that can extract a witness from the proof.
