\section{Algebra Types}\label{sec:algebra-types}
Finally we are ready to present the \ualibhtml{Algebras} module of the \agdaualib. Here we use type theory and Agda to codify the most basic objects of universal algebra, such as \emph{operations} and \emph{signatures} (\S\ref{sec:oper-sign}), \emph{algebras} (\S\ref{sec:algebras}), \emph{product algebras} (\S\ref{sec:product-algebras}), \emph{congruence relations} and \emph{quotient algebras}~(\S\ref{congruences}).

A popular way to represent algebraic structures in type theory is with record types. The Sigma type~(\S\ref{sec:dependent-types}) provides an equivalent alternative that we happen to prefer throughout the library, both for consistency and because of its direct connection to the existential quantifier of logic. Recall, from~\S\ref{sec:dependent-types}, the type \ad Σ~\ab x~\af ꞉~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x represents the proposition, ``there exists \ab x in \ab X such that \ab P~\ab x holds;'' in symbols, \as ∃~\ab x~\af ∈~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x.  Indeed, an inhabitant of  \ad Σ~\ab x~\af ꞉~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x is a pair (\ab x , \ab p) such that \ab x inhabits \ab X and \ab p is a proof of \ab P \ab x. In other terms, the pair (\ab x , \ab p) is a witness and proof of the proposition \as ∃~\ab x~\af ∈~\ab X~\af ,~\ab P~\ab x.
