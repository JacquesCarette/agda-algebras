Here we present the submodules of the \agdaualib's \ualibhtml{Relations} module. In \S\ref{sec:discrete-relations} we define types that represent \emph{unary} and \emph{binary relations}, which we refer to as ``discrete relations'' to contrast them with the (``continuous'') \emph{general} and \emph{dependent relations} that we introduce in \S\ref{sec:continuous-relations}. We call the latter ``continuous relations'' because they can have arbitrary arity (general relations) and they can be defined over arbitrary families of types (dependent relations).

Sections marked with an asterisk include new types that are more abstract and general than those presented elsewhere, but they are used only very rarely in other parts of the \ualib. Therefore, the sections marked * may be safely skimmed or skipped when first encountering them.}
