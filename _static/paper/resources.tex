For the required background in Universal Algebra, we recommend the textbook by Clifford Bergman~\cite{Bergman:2012}.  For the type theory background, we recommend the HoTT Book~\cite{HoTT} and Escard\'o's \ufcourse~\cite{MHE}.

The following are informed the development of the \ualib and are highly recommended.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{\ufcourse}, \escardo~\cite{MHE}
\item \href{http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~peterd/papers/DependentTypesAtWork.pdf}{\it Dependent Types at Work}, Bove and Dybjer~\cite{Bove:2009}
\item \href{http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ulfn/papers/afp08/tutorial.pdf}{\it Dependently Typed Programming in Agda}, Norell and Chapman~\cite{Norell:2008}
\item \href{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066118300768}{\it Formalization of Universal Algebra in Agda}, Gunther, Gadea, Pagano~\cite{Gunther:2018}
\item \href{https://plfa.github.io/}{\it Programming Languages Foundations in Agda}~\cite{Wadler:2020}
\end{itemize}

More information about \agdaualib can be obtained from the following official sources.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://ualib.gitlab.io}{\texttt{ualib.org}} (the web site) documents every line of code in the library.
  \item \href{https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io}{\texttt{gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io}} (the source code) \agdaualib is open source.\footnote{License: \href{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/}{Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.}}
  \item \emph{The Agda UALib}, \otherparta
  \item \emph{The Agda UALib}, \otherpartb
\end{itemize}
The first item links to the official \ualib html documentation which includes complete proofs of every theorem we mention here, and much more, including the Agda modules covered in the first and third installments of this series of papers on the \ualib.

Finally, readers will get much more out of the paper if they download \agdaualib from \url{https://gitlab.com/ualib/ualib.gitlab.io}, install the library, and try it out for themselves.
