abstract="In these lecture notes we give an introduction to functional programming with dependent types. We use the dependently typed programming language Agda which is an extension of Martin-L{\"o}f type theory. First we show how to do simply typed functional programming in the style of Haskell and ML. Some differences between Agda's type system and the Hindley-Milner type system of Haskell and ML are also discussed. Then we show how to use dependent types for programming and we explain the basic ideas behind type-checking dependent types. We go on to explain the Curry-Howard identification of propositions and types. This is what makes Agda a programming logic and not only a programming language. According to Curry-Howard, we identify programs and proofs, something which is possible only by requiring that all program terminate. However, at the end of these notes we present a method for encoding partial and general recursive functions as total functions using dependent types.",

abstract = {Abstract A version of Birkhoff's theorem is proved by constructive, predicative, methods. The version we prove has two conditions more than the classical one. First, the class considered is assumed to contain a generic family, which is defined to be a set-indexed family of algebras such that if an identity is valid in every algebra of this family, it is valid in every algebra of the class. Secondly, the class is assumed to be closed under inductive limits. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes generic design patterns to define and combine algebraic structures, using dependent records, coercions and type inference, inside the Coq system. This alternative to telescopes in particular supports multiple inheritance, maximal sharing of notations and theories, and automated structure inference. Our methodology is robust enough to handle a hierarchy comprising a broad variety of algebraic structures, from types with a choice operator to algebraically closed fields. Interfaces for the structures enjoy the convenience of a classical setting, without requiring any axiom. Finally, we present two applications of our proof techniques: a key lemma for characterising the discrete logarithm, and a matrix decomposition problem.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this work we present a novel formalization of universal algebra in Agda. We show that heterogeneous signatures can be elegantly modelled in type-theory using sets indexed by arities to represent operations. We prove elementary results of heterogeneous algebras, including the proof that the term algebra is initial and the proofs of the three isomorphism theorems. We further formalize equational theory and prove soundness and completeness. At the end, we define (derived) signature morphisms, from which we get the contravariant functor between algebras; moreover, we also proved that, under some restrictions, the translation of a theory induces a contra-variant functor between models.}
