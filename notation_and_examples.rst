Notation and Examples
======================

Notation
---------

Throughout, we denote and define the natural numbers as the following sets

.. math:: 0 := ‚àÖ, \quad 1 := \{0\}, \quad 2 := \{0, 1\}, \quad \dots, \quad n := \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1\}, \quad\dots

However, as this notation is known to cause confusion, we often remind the reader that the number :math:`n` should be viewed as a set by setting it in boldface; that is, we often write ùêß to denote the set :math:`\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}`.

We will denote the set of natural numbers by œâ or ‚Ñï, and we write :math:`n<œâ` (or :math:`n‚àà ‚Ñï`, or :math:`n:‚Ñï`) to indicate that :math:`n` is a natural number.

We write :math:`i<n` (or :math:`i‚àà ùêß`, or :math:`i:ùêß`) to indicate that :math:`i` belongs to the set :math:`\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}`.

The Cartesian product of objects :math:`A_0, A_1, \dots, A_{n-1}` is denoted by :math:`‚àè_ùêß A_i := A_0 √ó \cdots √ó A_{n-1}`.

An element :math:`ùêö ‚àà ‚àè_ùêß A_i` is an ordered :math:`n`-tuple, which may be specified by its graph, :math:`(ùêö(0), ùêö(1), \dots, ùêö(n-1))`.

Thus, tuples are functions defined on a (finite) index set, and this view may be emphasized symbolically as follows:

.. math:: ùêö: ùêß ‚Üí ‚ãÉ_ùêß A_i; \ i‚Ü¶ ùêö(i) ‚àà A_i.

If :math:`œÉ: ùê§ ‚Üí ùêß` is a :math:`k`-tuple of numbers from ùêß, then we can compose an n-tuple :math:`ùêö ‚àà ‚àè_ùêß A_i` with œÉ to obtain the k-tuple :math:`ùêö ‚àò œÉ ‚àà ‚àè_ùê§ A_{œÉ(i)}`.

Generally speaking, we will try to avoid nonstandard notational conventions, but here are two exceptions: let

.. math:: ùêÄ := ‚àè_ùêß A_i \quad \text{ and } \quad ùêÄ_œÉ := ‚àè_ùê§ A_{œÉ(i)}.

Now, if the k-tuple œÉ: ùê§ ‚Üí ùêß happens to be one-to-one, and if we let :math:`p_œÉ` denote the map ùêö ‚Ü¶ ùêö ‚àò œÉ, then :math:`p_œÉ` is the usual :term:`projection operation` from ùêÄ onto :math:`ùêÄ_œÉ`.

Thus, :math:`p_œÉ(ùêö)` is a k-tuple whose i-th component is (ùêö ‚àò œÉ)(i) = ùêö(œÉ(i)).

We will make frequent use of such projections, as well as their images under the covariant and contravariant powerset functors ùí´ and :math:`ùí´^{\leftarrow}`.

Indeed, we let :math:`\mathrm{Proj}_œÉ: ùí´(ùêÄ) ‚Üí ùí´(ùêÄ_œÉ)` denote the **projection set function** defined for each :math:`R ‚äÜ ùêÄ` by

.. math:: \mathrm{Proj}_œÉ R = ùí´ (p_œÉ)(R) = \{p_œÉ(ùê±) ‚à£ ùê± ‚àà R\} = \{ùê± ‚àò œÉ ‚à£ ùê± ‚àà R\},

and we let :math:`\mathrm{Inj}_œÉ: ùí´^‚Üê(ùêÄ_œÉ) ‚Üí ùí´^‚Üê(ùêÄ)` denote the **injection set function** defined for each :math:`S ‚äÜ ùêÄ_œÉ` by

.. math:: \mathrm{Inj}_œÉ S = ùí´^‚Üê(p_œÉ)(S) = \{ùê± ‚à£ p_œÉ(ùê±) ‚àà S\} = \{ùê± ‚àà ùêÄ ‚à£ ùê± ‚àò œÉ ‚àà S\}.
   :label: 19

Of course, :math:`\mathrm{Inj}_œÉ S` is nothing more than the inverse image of the set :math:`S` with respect to the projection function :math:`p_œÉ`.

We sometimes use the shorthand :math:`R_œÉ := \mathrm{Proj}_œÉ R` and :math:`S^{\overleftarrow{œÉ}} = \mathrm{Inj}_œÉ S` for the projection and injection set functions, respectively.

Examples of algebras
----------------------

Recall from above that an algebra :math:`ùî∏` is an ordered pair :math:`ùî∏ = ‚ü®A, F^ùî∏‚ü©` where :math:`A` is a nonempty set and :math:`F` is a family of finitary operations on :math:`A`.

The set :math:`A` is called the **universe** of :math:`ùî∏`, and the elements :math:`f^ùî∏ ‚àà F` are called the **basic operations** of :math:`ùî∏`.

(In practice we often write :math:`f` instead of :math:`f^ùî∏` when no ambiguity could result from this shorthand.

Here is a list of a few of the most frequently encountered and historically important algebraic structures. [1]_

.. glossary:: 

   magma
     An algebra :math:`‚ü®A, ‚ãÖ‚ü©` with a single binary operation is called a **magma** (or **groupoid** or **binar**). The operation is usually denoted by :math:`+` or :math:`‚ãÖ`, and we write :math:`a+b` or :math:`a ‚ãÖ b` (or just :math:`ab`) for the image of :math:`(a, b)` under this operation, which we call the *sum* or *product* of :math:`a` and :math:`b`, respectively.

   semigroup
     A magma :math:`‚ü®A, ‚ãÖ‚ü©` whose binary operation is associative is called a **semigroup**.  That is, a semigroup is a magma whose binary operation satisfies :math:`‚àÄ a, b, c ‚àà A`, :math:`(a ‚ãÖ b) ‚ãÖ c = a ‚ãÖ (b ‚ãÖ c)`.

   monoid
     If :math:`‚ü®A, ‚ãÖ‚ü©` is a semigroup and if :math:`e ‚àà A` is a *multiplicative identity* (i.e., :math:`‚àÄ a ‚àà A`, :math:`e ‚ãÖ a = a ‚ãÖ e = a`), then :math:`‚ü®A, \{e, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` is called a **monoid**.

   group
     A **group** is a monoid along with a unary operation :math:`^{-1}` called *multiplicative inverse*. That is, the reduct :math:`‚ü® A, \{e, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` is a monoid and :math:`^{-1}` satisfies :math:`a ‚ãÖ a^{-1} =  a^{-1} ‚ãÖ a = e`, for all :math:`a ‚àà A`.
  
   Abelian group
     A group is called **abelian** just in case its binary operation is commutative, in which case we usually denote the operation by :math:`+` instead of :math:`‚ãÖ`. Also in this case we let :math:`0` (instead of :math:`e`) denote the *additive identity*, and we let :math:`-\,` (instead of :math:`^{-1}`) denote the *additive inverse*. Thus, an **abelian group** is a group :math:`ùî∏ = ‚ü® A, 0, -,+‚ü©` such that :math:`a+b = b+a` for all :math:`a, b ‚àà A`.

   ring
     An algebra :math:`‚ü®R, \{0, -, +, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` is called a **ring** just in case the following conditions hold:

       #. the reduct :math:`‚ü®R, \{0, -,+\}‚ü©` is an abelian group,
       #. the reduct :math:`‚ü®R, ‚ãÖ ‚ü©` is a semigroup, and
       #. "multiplication" :math:`‚ãÖ` distributes over "addition" :math:`+`; that is, :math:`‚àÄ a, b, c ‚àà R`, :math:`a ‚ãÖ (b+c) = a ‚ãÖ b + a ‚ãÖ c` and :math:`(a+b)‚ãÖ c = a ‚ãÖ c + b ‚ãÖ c`.

     A **ring with unity** (or **unital ring**) is an algebra :math:`‚ü®R, \{0, 1, -, +, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` with a ring reduct :math:`‚ü®R, \{0, -, +, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` and a *multiplicative identity* :math:`1 ‚àà R`; that is :math:`‚àÄ r ‚àà R`, :math:`r ‚ãÖ 1 = r = 1 ‚ãÖ r`.

     If :math:`‚ü®R, \{0, 1, -, +, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` is a unital ring, an element :math:`r ‚àà R` is called a **unit** if it has a multiplicative inverse, that is, there exists :math:`s ‚àà R` with :math:`r ‚ãÖ s = 1 = s ‚ãÖ r`.  (We usually denote such an :math:`s` by :math:`r^{-1}`.)

   division ring
     A ring in which every non-zero element is a unit is called a **division ring**.

   field
     A commutative division ring is called a **field**.

   module
     Let :math:`R` be a ring with unit. A **left unitary** :math:`R`-**module** (or simply :math:`R`-**module**) is an algebra :math:`‚ü®M, \{0, -, +\} ‚à™ \{f_r : r‚àà R\}‚ü©` with an abelian group reduct :math:`‚ü®M, \{0, -, +\}‚ü©` and unary operations :math:`\{f_r : r ‚àà R\}` that satisfy the following: :math:`‚àÄ r, s ‚àà R`, :math:`‚àÄ x, y ‚àà M`,

       #. :math:`f_r(x + y)  = f_r(x) + f_r(y)`
       #. :math:`f_{r+s}(x) = f_r(x) + f_s(x)`
       #. :math:`f_r(f_s(x)) = f_{rs}(x)`
       #. :math:`f_1(x) = x`.

     Note that Condition 1 says that each :math:`f_r` is an :term:`endomorphism` of the abelian group :math:`‚ü® M, \{0, -, +\}‚ü©`, while the other conditions amount to the following: (1) the set :math:`E := \{f_r ‚à£ r‚àà R\}` of endomorphisms is a ring with unit where multiplication is function composition, and (2) the map :math:`r ‚Ü¶ f_r` is a ring :term:`epimorphism` from :math:`R` onto :math:`E`.

     One reason modules are important is that every ring is, up to isomorphism, a ring of endomorphisms of some abelian group. This fact is analogous to the more familiar theorem of Cayley stating that every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations of some set.

   vector space
     In :math:`R` happens to be a field, then an :math:`R`-module is typically called a **vector space** over :math:`R`.

   bilinear algebra
     If :math:`ùîΩ = ‚ü®F, \{0, 1, -, ‚ãÖ\}‚ü©` is a field, then the algebra :math:`ùî∏ = ‚ü®A, \{0, -, +, ‚ãÖ\} ‚à™ \{f_r ‚à£ r ‚àà F\}‚ü©` is called a **bilinear algebra** over :math:`ùîΩ` provided

       #. :math:`‚ü®A, \{0, -, +\} ‚à™ \{f_r ‚à£ r ‚àà F\}‚ü©` is a vector space over :math:`ùîΩ` and 
       #. :math:`‚àÄ a, b, c ‚àà A`, :math:`‚àÄ r ‚àà F`,

       .. math:: \begin{gather}
                 (a + b) ‚ãÖ c = (a ‚ãÖ c) + (b ‚ãÖ c),\\
                 c ‚ãÖ (a + b) = (c ‚ãÖ a) + (c ‚ãÖ b),\\
                 a ‚ãÖ f_r(b) = f_r(a ‚ãÖ b) = f_r(a) ‚ãÖ b.
                 \end{gather}

     If in addition :math:`(a ‚ãÖ b) ‚ãÖ c = a ‚ãÖ (b ‚ãÖ c)` for all :math:`a, b, c ‚àà A`, then :math:`ùî∏` is called an **associative algebra** over :math:`ùîΩ`. Thus an associative algebra over a field has both a vector space reduct and a ring reduct. An example of an associative algebra is the space of *linear transformations* (endomorphisms) of any vector space into itself.
