## <a id="birkhoffs-theorem">Birkhoff's Theorem</a>

This chapter presents the [Birkhoff][] module of the [Agda Universal Algebra Library][].

Here we give a formal proof in [MLTT][] of Birkhoff's theorem which says that a variety is an equational class. In other terms, a class ùí¶ of algebras is closed under the operators `H`, `S`, and `P` if and only if ùí¶ is the class of algebras that satisfy some set of identities.

\begin{code}

{-# OPTIONS --without-K --exact-split --safe #-}

module Birkhoff where

open import Birkhoff.FreeAlgebra
open import Birkhoff.HSPTheorem

\end{code}
